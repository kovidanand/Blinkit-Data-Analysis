Blinkit Data Analysis Project
📊 Blinkit Sales Analysis – Comprehensive Python-based exploratory data analysis of Blinkit grocery sales data, uncovering trends in product performance, outlet efficiency, and customer preferences.

Project Purpose
This Jupyter Notebook project performs in-depth EDA on Blinkit sales datasets to deliver actionable business insights. It focuses on data cleaning, statistical summaries, and visualizations that reveal sales drivers, category performance, and outlet strategies for grocery delivery optimization.

Tech Stack
🐍 Python 3.x – Core programming language with Jupyter Notebook environment.

📊 Pandas & NumPy – Data manipulation, cleaning, and numerical computations.

📈 Matplotlib & Seaborn – Statistical visualizations and plotting.

🔢 Descriptive Statistics – Summary metrics for sales, ratings, and outlet KPIs.

Data Source
Source: Blinkit grocery sales dataset with transactional records.

Key Fields:

Item details (fat content, type, MRP, sales volume).

Outlet characteristics (size, location, establishment year).

Performance metrics (ratings, revenue).

Key Features & Highlights
Business Problem
Grocery platforms need to identify top-selling categories, optimal outlet strategies, and product-outlet synergies to maximize revenue and efficiency.

Analysis Goals
Quantify item and outlet performance across dimensions.

Visualize distributions and correlations for decision-making.

Extract insights on sales patterns and growth opportunities.

Key Visuals & Findings
Fat Content Distribution (Pie Chart): Regular items dominate (65%) over low-fat options.

Item Type Performance (Bar Chart): Household essentials and snacks lead sales.

Outlet Age vs Sales (Line/Scatter): Older outlets show stable revenue; newer ones scale rapidly.

Top Categories by Volume: Snacks, household items outperform fresh produce.

Outlet Insights: Large urban outlets generate 40% higher revenue than small rural ones.
